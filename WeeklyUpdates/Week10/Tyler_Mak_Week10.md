1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
    18.5
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring)
   - Wrote Tech Memo draft and made small adjustments to it for final Tech Memo after receiving feedback from peers: 4 hours
   - Held in person meeting with Celeste & Leenesh for helping code their subsystem and test cases for their subsystem: 9.5 hours
   - Adjusted Web GUI elements to match wireframe and make sure sizes of each element was visible on all types of devices: 1 hour
   - Create test cases for camera and load sensor hardware: 30 mins
   - Create test cases for camera object detection and load sensor weight detection: 1 hour
   - Refactor Web GUI test cases for Unit Test demo: 1 hour
   - Performed Unit Test Demo: 30 mins
   - Held ITP metrics meeting: 1 hour
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - I was able to meet both my team members in person :)
  - I created working test cases for the Bed Detection subsystem and Web GUI
  - I adjusted Web GUI elements to match the wireframe in the Detailed Design document
  - I found a place where I might be able to go to ask for help with soldering to fix the load sensor problem. [Website](https://hacklab.to/) 
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I'm glad I properly have the Web GUI finished and most likely only need to do small adjustments from now on.
  - I am happy that the Unit Test demo went fine.
  - I am glad I got to see both my teamates in person. :)
  - I hope this place I will be going to on Tuesday will help me solder my load sensor connections.
  - I hope soldering truely is the root of the problem and it isn't due to the load sensor itself.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Go to the HackLab.to location and try to solder wire connections on load sensor.
  - Help figure out Leenesh's hardware communication problems.
  - Fix up any problems that may occur with Bed Detection or Web GUI code
  - Figure out a way for camera person detection to still detect person if they aren't facing the camera.
  - Complete code review for Eduflow
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - Nothing this week.
