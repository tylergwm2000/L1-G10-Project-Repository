1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**  
   7
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)  
   - Working on Detailed Design Report with teammates: 4 hours 
   - Researching methods for Alarm Clock implementation: 2.5 hours
   - Meeting with team to discuss time to meet in-person next week: 30 minutes
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  -This week I worked on the Detailed Design Document draft
  - I learnt the different libraries that could be used for the Alarm clock.
  - Looked at ways to write code that looks professional in both implementation and presentation
  - Discussed common day of the week with Celeste and Tyler for in-person meetups for the project
  - Reminded everyone in meeting of tasks and who is alloted specific jobs
  -   So far the progress in the tasks has started as Tyler has written a script for the beddetection and I have started the script for my Alarm clock. We have developed a means
  for the team Raspberry Pis to have end-to-end communications. Celeste has also said that she is looking at how to implement code for the Sprayclock, she has found cases for protecting
  the raspberry pi's from damage.
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - This week I beleive our group is working at a good pace. We are at where we wanted to be. I do get intimidated at times by my teammate Tyler's progress as he is working ahead
  of schedule, however I am happy with how I am doing.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - I want to meet with my group-mates in-person as I think its finally time to see each other and start working with the components we have received.
  - I will also want to make sure that I am finished a majority of the alarm clock script so that I am ready for the end-to-end communication demo next Friday during Lab 8.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - As of now I do not think Im being necessarily blocked by others. I feel that everything is going well so far. Most of the doubts I get now are thing that can be answered with a
  quick google search.
