1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**  
   18
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)  
   - Held meeting with Celeste for confirming and finalizing parts to order from DigiKey & department: 30 mins (Feb 21)
   - Research how to use HX711 board with load sensor in python: 1.5 hours
   - Create Firebase database for project use
   - Begin writing code for Bed Detection subsystem: 4 hours
   - Research possible object detection and computer vision options to use for camera in Bed Detection subsystem: 2 hours
   - Research how to use dash to create an interactive Web GUI: 2 hours
   - Begin writing code for Web GUI: 4 hours
   - Begin writing and work on Draft Design Document: 4 hours
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_  
  - I found the following GitHub repos for coding with HX711 board: [1](https://github.com/tatobari/hx711py), [2](https://github.com/mpibpc-mroose/hx711), [3](https://github.com/gandalf15/HX711).
  - I wrote all the basic code needed for Bed Detection subsystem and used Lab5 basic computer vision temporarily 
  - I repeatedly used (https://dash.plotly.com/) to find necessary components needed to create Web GUI
  - I wrote all code for Web GUI and have a website with a graph and some other features
  - In the design document I finished sections 2.1 & 2.2, added all tables in 2.2.1, created all message sequence diagrams in section 2.3, created all figures in section 2.4, and created all fritzing diagrams in section 4.
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_  
  - I am glad I have most of the code needed for Bed Detection subsystem written.
  - I am happy to see the website GUI functioning and showing a graph.
  - I am worried about writing test case programs next week.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Collect ordered parts and create a test circuit for my Bed Detection subsystem.
  - Research more on object detection and computer vision for camera.
  - Create test case programs to test end-to-end communication for Friday.
  - Finish draft Detailed Design document by Tuesday and final document by due date.
  - Continue writing code for Web GUI and Bed Detection subsystem.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_  
  - Nothing this week, but a bit worried about their progress.
