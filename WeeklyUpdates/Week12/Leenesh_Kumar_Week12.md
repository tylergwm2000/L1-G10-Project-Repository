1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**  
    9
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring)
   - Tried to implement new code for Alarm clock's lcd screen: 2 hours
   - Tried make pushbutton more consistent: 1 hour 30 min
   - Worked on README file with teammates: 2 hours
   - Performed Final Project demo: 30 mins
   - Worked on Final Project Report: 3 hours
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_  
  - I created a new test program for my Alarm Clock subsystem
  - I finished all possible sections I could for the toplevel README.md file
  - I performed the Final Project demo with my teamates
  - I worked on the Final Project report
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_  
  - I am happy that the Final Demo is done.
  - I am not happy with how my lcd screen did not work as it could have saved the project
  - I am happy I learned new skills, however I want to learn more about GPIO and in general what the solution to my problem was
  - The project got stressful at times where sometimes I had a doubt I would automatically resort to asking my teammate which felt embarrasing. Over time however,
  I learned to look for information myself and give my own kick at the can. It may not have worked overall, but I got a new confidence in myself.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_  
  - Finish and submit Final Project report
  - Study for my final exam
  - Hopefully I pass the course. I hope my subsystem not running as intended does not hurt my teammates overall mark.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - This time I have nothing. Thank you for a great semester. I hope to become stronger and take more initiative.
