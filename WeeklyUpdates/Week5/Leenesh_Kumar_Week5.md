3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
   This week our group worked on our SprayClock project proposal. Myself, Tyler and Celeste and gathered to work on the proposal draft Monday and then on Tuesday. Approximately
   worked on this document for 8-10 hours. We then finished our final proposal based upon feedback received by our peers. Our group decided to use Firebase as our database and that
   we would need to get additional materials from digikey.
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
   Definetly glad my group finished the project proposal on Thursday, well before the deadline. I am kind of upset with the truckers convoy delaying the arrival of my raspberry pi
   until Saturday night even though my friend made the extra effort to ship it to me. I will need to finish lab 5 asap as I need to be prepared for the lab exam next week.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  My number one priortiy for next week is to take another look at past labs and try to remember how particular tasks were performed in order to prepare for the lab exam. I also
  want to start progress on the actual project as the reading week approaches.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  While our entire group had met up to finish the draft proposal, our team member Celeste was absent for our final submission and for changes we were making based upon feedback. We 
  were waiting for her to join us to submit the proposal to make sure she also approved but she was missing. I hope that going forward, Celeste will be able to attend meetings.
