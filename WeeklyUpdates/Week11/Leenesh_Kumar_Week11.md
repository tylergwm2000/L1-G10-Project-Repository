___
1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
    12
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring) 
   - Modified code to describe programs and to add flake8 output as comments: 1 hour
   - Submitted code for peer code review and evaluated others code to later reflect on feedback: 3 hours
   - Met with Tyler and Celeste to create content for a video and record: 7 hours 
   - Helped Tyler complete pull requests and organize github: 1 hour
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - I was able to submit my code for peer review and evaluate others code.
  - Reflected on feedback given on my code
  - Finished recording video for final project demonstation
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - My LCD screen still does not show the intended message although it turns on. The same problem for the buzzer as well. I tried all methods online and experimented on my own as well. Nothing is happening. It is frustruating as the final demo is near and Im not able to get proper output. I hope I dont pull my teammates down if part of my subsystem refuses to work during the Final Demo. I hope I pass the course. I'm really trying everything in my power to figure this out.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - I have tried hard to fix the LCD and Buzzer problems but they persist. My teammates have advised me that we may not be penalized too much as I still put lots of effort into my portion of the project. I will look to complete the final project report next week and just say what I know in the live demo. Hope to pass.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - Nothing necessarily blocking me. I'm just annoyed that none of the code Im looking at for LCD screen is solving my problem.
