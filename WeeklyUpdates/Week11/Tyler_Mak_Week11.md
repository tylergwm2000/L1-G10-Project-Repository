   - Submitted backend.py for code review & reviewed and implemented suggested changes from peer: 1 hour
   - Went to Hacklab.to location and learned how to solder, what a crimping tool is, how to use crimping tool and other cool engineering tools: 3 hours
   - Adjusted Web GUI element sizes: 30 mins
   - Using newly soldered hx711 breakout board & load cell, successfully tested load sensor: 30 mins
   - Fixed sleep time constantly updating bug & fix logic for inaccurate load sensor readings: 1 hour
   - Changed comparison value such that camera detection works even if person not facing camera: 30 mins
   - Refactored and looked over Alarm subsystem main.py code: 2 hours
   - Worked on slide deck for Final Video deliverable: 2 hours
   - Held online meeting with group to record and finish up slide deck for Final Video: 8 hours
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - I was able to go to Hacklab.to & learn many new skills and see many big engineering tools in person
  - I fixed Web GUI bugs and adjusted GUI elements for all device screens
  - I fixed the problem of the load cell constantly reading an incorrect value problem
  - I made sure camera detection works even if person not facing camera
  - I reviewed Alarm Clock subsystem code, made changes and made a pull request
  - I worked on the Final Video deliverable 
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I hope I will no longer have to touch the Web GUI and it is bug free. (probably not) 
  - I am extremely happy that I got to meet volunteer engineers to help me with soldering and crimping for the load sensor problem
  - I am happy to see the load sensor properly fuunctioning.
  - I am a bit sad there seems to be some incorrect load sensor reading values.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Review Spray subsystem code & make any necessary changes.
  - Figure out why load sensor still sometimes gets incorrect values.
  - Perform Final Demo.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - Nothing this week.
