   - Held a meeting with my teammates where we finalized the draft for the Detailed Design Document: 10 hours (Mar 8, Meeting from 2:30 PM - 12:00 AM)
   - Held a meeting with Tyler where he helped me fully understand Lab 3 and complete it in preparation for the Test Demo: 3 Hours
   - Finished writing code for the Spray System and tested it with the help of Tyler: 5 hours (Mar 10, 7:00 PM - 12:00 AM)
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_  
  - I wrote all the code needed for the Spray System!
  - I created the Gantt Chart in Excel for our upcoming milestones and plans to reach them!
  - With Tyler's help, I envisioned what our SprayClock Website should look like and include!
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_  
  - I feel more confident since I was able to make the code for the Spray System admist feeling overwhelmingly behind at times! It pushed me to go forward!
  - Once I was finally able to attend the Test Demo, I was too late sadly as I had arrived at 2:30 PM. However, even though I missed the actual Test Demo due to unforeseen circumstances, I didn't hinder my teammates from completeing the session thankfully.
  - I am super relieved that my teammates and I were able to finalize the Detailed Design Document.
  - Honestly, I am really glad I opened up about my struggles a bit with my groupmates. I felt fully supported as Leenesh comforted me on my current situation and Tyler checked in on me when I was worried about the Final Demo Test. I know moving forward, I can open up more and continue to try my best with their support!
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
   - I aim to really catch up in the course and I am more confident that I can do so as I have notified the right people of my situation and can feel I have the full support of my team! Specifically, I want to upload all the content I have for the labs and notify Victoria (my TA) once I have done so as I had gotten behind on those labs and writing my commit changes on them!
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_  
  - Nothing at all!
