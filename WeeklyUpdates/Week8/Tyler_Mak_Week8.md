1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**  
   27.5
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)  
   - Held meeting with team for working on draft detailed design document: 10 hours
   - Added a couple more GUI elements to Web GUI
   - Create test programs for End-to-end demo for Bed Detection subsystem and Web GUI: 1.5 hours
   - Help Leenesh with programming Alarm subsystem for End-to-end demo: 1.5 hour
   - Help Celeste with Lab 3 Firebase content & programming Spray subsystem for End-to-end demo: 8 hours
   - Perform End-to-end demo: 30 mins
   - Hold meeting for reviewing feedbacks from Eduflow and make changes to detailed design document: 3 hours
   - Continue writing code on Bed Detection subsystem (Camera person detection): 3 hours
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_  
  - I learned how to use pytest to create python test cases for my bed detection subsystem and Web GUI
  - My team and I finished writing the final detailed design document
  - Leenesh and I performed the End-to-end demo
  - I was finally able to install TensorFlow lite and OpenCV onto my Raspberry Pi
  - I found the following GitHub for TensorFlow lite object detection specifically for my usecase: (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/examples/python)
  - I started writing code for using TensorFlow lite with the RPi camera for person detection
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_  
  - I am glad I finally was able to install TensorFlow lite and OpenCV as I was having trouble with it last week.
  - I am happy to see the website GUI end-to-end communication working properly.
  - I am happy that I got object detection working using the above GitHub's examples and other examples I found online.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Collect ordered parts and create a test circuit for my Bed Detection subsystem.
  - Complete writing code for Bed Detection's camera person detection.
  - Complete writing code for Bed Detection's load sensor person detection. (If I receive the parts)
  - Update Web GUI code such that it is separated into two python files instead of one.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_  
  - Nothing this week, hopefully we can meet in person this week.
