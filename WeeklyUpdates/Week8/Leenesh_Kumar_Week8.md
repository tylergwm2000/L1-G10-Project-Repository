2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)  
   - Held meeting with team for working on draft detailed design document: 10 hours
   - Worked with Tyler and created a program for the Alarm Clock subsystem: 3
   - Testing Alarm Clock Subsystem program with Tyler to check if its properly sending data to firebase: 2 hours

   - Worked with team to improve detailed design document based on eduflow feedback: 3 hours
   - Perform End-to-end demo: 30 mins
   - Researching ways to add Audio to the Alarm Clock Subsystem: 1 hour 
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_  
  - I learned learnt how to add audio to the Alarm Clock Subsystem
  - I finished writing the final detailed design document with the team
  - Tyler and I performed the End-to-end demo
  - I finished most parts of the Alarm Clock Subsystem program. Just two more methods that I will need to design.
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_  
  - I feel really good about my progress. I started out behind in terms of programs or work done, however I am now caught up. Definetly became a stronger python programmer. 
  many of the tasks from here will be a lot more up my alley.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - The main thing to do now is to really just finish the pushbutton class and the deleteAlarm method. Once these have been implemented I can wire the components together to run 
  a full test.
  - Make sure once pushbutton is true that the firebase understands.
  - Reading information from firebase once an alarm has rang.
  - Have Tyler check Web GUI for the time and alarms set
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_  
  - Nothing at the moment. I'm glad that Celeste is more free now to help the team after everything she went through. Goal is to meet next Tuesday in-person.
