3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - I held a meeting with Leenesh to finalize our project idea. (Sleep cycle alarm clock with spray functionality)
  - I worked on the pre-proposal by creating the UML deployment diagram and writing the milestones.
  - Participated in meeting with Leenesh and Victoria for confirming project idea satisfies all the requirements and is a good project.
  - I helped Leenesh complete Lab4.
  - I helped Celeste catch up on previous labs. 
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I enjoyed learning more about GitHub features such as branching, issues, pull requests, and merging. 
  - I had fun learning and using Roger's [mini-project repository](https://github.com/roger-selzler/SYSC3010Lab4) to create pixel art on the browser and had it reflect on my or a teamate's sensehat hardware.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Learn and complete everything required for Lab5.
  - Research possible pressure sensors to use for project or if they are needed at all.
  - Determine which database and GUI to use for our project.
  - Begin and complete writing project proposal.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - For Lab4 the GitHub and mini-project repository section's required team member's to be working on the same sections at the same time in order to continue to the next step.  
  I started Lab4 a day early before the Lab session and finished everything that I could possibly do on my own. Because of this during the Lab session, I was primarily helping my team  
  member's catch up, waiting until they needed my help or finally reached the section's requiring teamwork (which wasn't until 10 mins before the lab ended T_T).
