4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I learnt how to use GitHub features to push, pull, merge, branch through git. Overall I definetly know I am making progess. However, I do feel for my teammate Tyler who is helping
  since I am not as quick of a learner.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Finish Lab5 ahead of time. In order to review everything learnt in labs prior in preperation for lab exam. Find out good part to buy for our project which can be within budget.
  - Create a database for our project data. Finish our Project Proposal draft and then our Final Project Proposal before the weekend.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - So far I am getting whatever I need from others. However, as teamwork will be a huge factor in our project, everyone needs to be on the same page. As I am still behind my teammate,
  Tyler, but not as behind as I used to be. I need to start being his equal so I will not make him feel overwhelmed. At the same time, our teammate Celeste is very behind and this
  will block both me and Tyler as she is still not well-versed with the material.
