1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
   17
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring>   - Held meeting with team for working on draft detailed design document: 10 hours
   - Added remaining GUI elements to Web GUI: 30 mins
   - Held in person meeting with Leenesh for creating our respective subsystem's circuits and helping with coding Alarm: 4 hours
   - Refactored Web GUI code into two python files(backend and frontend): 1.5 hours
   - Successfully implement tensorflow object detection for camera's person detection: 5 hours
   - Code a hx711 python file for communicating with the HX711 breakout board for load sensor and acting as a library: 2 hours
   - Edit and add more test cases to Bed Detection pytest file: 30 mins
   - Create a test program for testing just the load sensor manually: 30 mins
   - Coded the remaining Web GUI elements functionalities: 2.5 hours
   - Create test cases for setting and deleting alarm for Web GUI: 30 mins
   - Ran into problem where readings received from the load sensor were always the same value
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - I implemented the tensorflow object detection for my camera in the Bed Detection subsystem
  - I got to meet Leenesh in person :)
  - I finished adding remaining GUI elements to Web GUI and coded their functionalities successfully
  - I wrote the hx711 library based off of the previously mentioned GitHub's in Week7
  - I added more test cases in the pytest programs for the Web GUI and Bed Detection subsystem along with a manual test for the load sensor 
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I am happy I got the tensorflow object detection working and was amazed at how it worked as I intended it to
  - I am happy to see the website GUI functioning properly with all desired GUI elements from the wireframe 
  - I am glad I got to see Leenesh in person and we were able to create circuits for our respective subsystems
  - I'm glad I figured out that the reason for getting the same reading for the load sensor was due to the wire connections.
  - I'm worried about how I will solve this problem or if I have to get rid of this component from the system.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Figure out a solution to getting load sensor to read values properly
  - Complete the Tech memo draft and final by Tuesday and its final due date
  - Prepare for Unit Test demo on Friday by creating more test cases and fixing any bugs.
  - Meet with group in person again if possible
  - Hold ITP metrics meeting with group when final team member finishes their assessment
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - Nothing this week, hopefully we can meet in person again. :)
