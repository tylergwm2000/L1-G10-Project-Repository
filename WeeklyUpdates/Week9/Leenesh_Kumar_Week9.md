   - Learnt how to implement an LCD screen in python: 3 hours
   - Learn how to add a buzzer in python: 1 hours
   - Researched about unit testing in order to find out how to create test cases for my subsystem: 2 hours
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - I learn how to wire circuits with raspberry pi according to gpio
  - I met Tyler in person to work on the project and catch up for old times sake
  - Finally got the pyrebase module working after correcting python version
  - I am learning how to learn
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I am happy I got to Tyler in person and we were able to work together on our project. Also, I am happy that I finally got the pyrebase module working. I do get 
  anxious sometimes when I have not started work and I think about the deadline, causing stress and if Im putting enough work into the course. Tyler tells me Im doing well
  but I should push to finish my tasks sooner and to google answers to some questions. I understand that at times I do not take advantage of outside resources and instead
  ask Tyler a lot. I want to contribute as much as I can.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Work on Tech memo. Decide what I want to make a tutorial on. I already have something in mind. Just want to make sure it is a good idea.
  - Complete the Tech memo draft on Tuesday
  - Prepare for Unit Test demo on Friday by creating test cases. I hope I have it in myself to do it without help
  - Meet with Tyler in person next week to fix any problems with circuits and make sure they responds to software implementation. We can also do a practice demo this day
  - Reflect upon ITP metrics results whenever final teammate finishes.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - I dont have anythig blocking me. I just get doubts about my abilities and sometimes worry about even failing the course. I try my best in team meetings and try to become
  - better, but Tyler is just a lot better than myself. All I can do is hope for the best, hope I will pass the course, and meet Tyler in-person next week.
