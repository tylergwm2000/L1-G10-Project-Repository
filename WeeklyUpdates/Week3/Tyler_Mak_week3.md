4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I am confident I am properly learning everything from the labs and am doing as much extra work for the labs as I can. 
  - I am a bit worried about our team project as we don't have a concrete idea on 
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Learn and complete everything required for Lab4.
  - Finalize rest of project idea and backup ideas if necessary.
  - Meet with TA to discuss whether our project ideas are feasible and finalize which of the 3 ideas we should use.
  - Begin writing project proposol.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - Parts of Lab3 required API keys from team member's, I worked ahead of time and was therefore ahead of both my team member's in the labs.
    This is not a large problem since, I decided to use my API keys instead so I wouldn't be forced to wait for them.
