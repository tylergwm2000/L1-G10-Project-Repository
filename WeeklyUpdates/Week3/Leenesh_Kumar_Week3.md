How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)
This week was much better than week 2 as I was able to start lab3 at a fair time and work at a good pace. Im very happy with how I am progressing through the course. I still did ask my teammate from some help here and there, but I was not suffering. 

What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)
I hope to finalize a project idea with my team. Also, just as Tyler has helped me, I want to continue helping Celeste catchup with labs.

Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)

I am not a good coder or programmer. Therefore it is hard for me to understand certain syntax and errors that a normal programmer would be able to solve on the fly. Even after
looking for the answer and trying numerous times, I just am not able to understand. Luckily my teammate is able to help me understand key concepts even the TA could not make me
understand.
