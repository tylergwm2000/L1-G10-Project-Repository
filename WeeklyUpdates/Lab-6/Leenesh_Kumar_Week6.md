1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**  
   3
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)  
   - Familiarizing myself with previous lab technologies: 2 hours 
   - Lab Exam: 20 minutes
   - Meeting with team to discuss component request form and what to fill in: 30 minutes
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - This week I did my lab exam and familiarized myself with prior technology
  - Held online meeting with Tyler for any clarify or doubts on previous lab exercises that were not finished
  - Had meeting with Celeste Thursday to help her with labs 2-5
  - Discussed common day of the week with Celeste and Tyler for in-person meetups for the project
  - Become profficient with git
  - Reminded everyone in meeting of tasks and who is alloted specific jobs
  -   So far the progress in the tasks has not been visible yet as the past week was very busy with midterm studying and project iterations due date. Over the reading week,
  Tyler said he will starting the Web GUI and I will be looking at designs for the sprayclock to find out what would be most efficient, cost-effective and takes least time to create.
  Celeste said that she will be looking at getting protective cases for the raspberry pis in order for them to not get wet. 
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - So far, I beleive I have been making steady progress. Things have been progessing slowly due to midterms and studying in the last week. However, now the I'm fully
  committed to going full steam ahead. I may not have done as well on my lab exam as I would have liked, but I know that if Im able to contribute well enough to my team project,
  that I have demonstarted my proficiency with the technology thought in the course.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - I will be researching possible motors to use for spray subsystem and the optimal design for it.
  - I will also be researching the type of communication and connection our additional harware will need to function simultaneously with the Raspberry Pis.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - As of now I do not think Im being necessarily blocked by other. But I do hope our teammate Celeste is able to catch up in terms of proficiency with the technology so that
  she will be able to contribute. She is a very good worker but needs to be on the same page as us.
